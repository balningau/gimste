Word: tarmi
Rafsi: tam, tai
Definition: x1 [ideal] is the conceptual shape/form of object/abstraction/manifestation
  x2 (object/abstract).
Notes: Also pattern; $x_1$ is the mathematical or theoretical ideal form, while $x_2$
  is an object/event manifesting that form; e.g. circular/circle-shaped (= {cukseltai})
  vs. circle (={cuktai}, while {cukla} alone is ambiguous); model (= {ci'ersaptai},
  {saptai}, {ci'ersmitai}, {smitai}).  See alse {nejni}, te {marji} for physical shape,
  {tapla}, {bliku}, {kubli}, {kurfa}, {cukla}, {mapti}, {morna}, {sarlu}.
