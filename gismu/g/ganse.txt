Definition: x1 [observer] senses/detects/notices stimulus property x2 (ka) by means x3 under conditions x4.

Notes:
$x_1$ is sensitive to $x_2$; also feels, spots, perceives, makes out, discerns/recognizes (but only implying reaction without necessarily any significant mental processing); note that the emphasis is on a property which stimulates $x_1$ and is detected (sanji is passive about the sensing, and is not limited to sensory input, as well as presuming some kind of discernment/recognition, while not being concerned with the means of detection); $x_3$ sense/sensory channel.  See also {pencu}, {sanji}, {viska}, {sumne}, {tirna}, {zgana}, {canci}, {simlu}.
