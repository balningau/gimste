Word: dunda
Rafsi: dud, du'a
Definition: x1 [donor] gives/donates gift/present x2 to recipient/beneficiary x3 [without
  payment/exchange].
Notes: Also grants; $x_3$ is a receiver (= {terdu'a} for reordered places); the Lojban
  doesn't distinguish between or imply possession transfer or sharing; $x_2$ may be
  a specific object, a commodity (mass), an event, or a property; pedantically, for
  objects/commodities, this is sumti-raising from ownership of the object/commodity
  (= {posydu'a}, {posyseldu'a} for unambiguous semantics).  See also {benji}, {muvdu},
  {canja}, {pleji}, {vecnu}, {friti}, {sfasa}, {dapma}, {cnemu}, {prali}.
Examples: None
