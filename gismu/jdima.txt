jdima - di'a
x1 [amount] is the price of x2 to purchaser/consumer x3 set by vendor x4.

$x_2$ may be a specific object, a commodity (mass), an event, or a property; pedantically, for objects/commodities, this is sumti-raising from ownership of the object/commodity (= {posydi'a}, {posyseldi'a} for unambiguous semantics); price is something decided/set by the seller, and is closely akin to offer ({friti}), which is what a buyer may decide; (note that price is not he same as cost/expense, which is the actual amount exchanged in a transaction; the latter is {vecnu} or {canja}; neither is the same as "value" or {vamji}; in colloquial English, these are sometimes interchanged, at least partially because of the rarity of barter and bargaining in the marketplace).  See also {canja}, {friti}, {janta}, {jdini}, {kargu}, {pleji}, {dapma}, {vamji} for 'value', ve {vecnu} for 'cost', {canja}, {fepni}, {jerna}, {jinga}, {prali}, {rupnu}, {sfasa}, {vamji}.
