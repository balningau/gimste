Word: notci
Rafsi: not, noi
Definition: x1 is a message/notice/memorandum about subject x2 from author x3 to intended
  audience x4.
Notes: 'Emphasis on brevity, single or identifiable subject (contrast with xatra:
  the emphasis in notci is on the single or cohesively focused subject, while the
  audience is less defined - indeed only an ''intended'' audience.  xatra need not
  have a single or focussed subject - its corresponding place is for ''content'');
  reminder/memo/note (= {mojnoi}).  See also {xatra}, {nuzba}, {mrilu}, {morji}.'
