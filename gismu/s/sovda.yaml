Word: sovda
Rafsi: sov, so'a
Definition: x1 is an egg/ovum/sperm/pollen/gamete of/from organism [mother/father]
  x2.
Notes: '(poorly metaphorical only due to gender- and species- being unspecified):
  ovoid, oblate (= {pevyso''aseltai}, but better: {claboi}); egg, specifically female
  (= {fetso''a}), of a bird (= {cpifetso''a}, {cpiso''a}), of a chicken (= {jipcyfetso''a},
  {jipcyso''a}. (but note that Lojban does not require specificity, just as English
  doesn''t for either milk or eggs; "sovda" is fine for most contexts); If fertilized,
  then {tsiju} or {tarbi}.  (cf. {ganti}, {gutra}, {mamta}, {patfu}, {rorci}, {tsiju},
  {lanbi}, {tarbi}; also {djine}, {konju} for shape, {tarbi})'
