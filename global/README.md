This folder will list the global proposals (ones that apply to many gismu).

In order to be lazy about creating the PR, the proposals will just be represented
by a text file in this folder describing the change. Discussion and voting
will happen on the PR, and then accepted proposals will be applied afterwards
(presumably by someone proficient in the use of `grep`).

In the web interface, you can add a file by clicking the "+" button above
(next to "gimste / global /").

Please include the following sections in your proposal, where
appropriate:

Summary
-------
A brief (one or two sentences) summary of the proposed change.

Detail
------
Here's the more detailed description of what should be changed, along
with justifications for why. Include possible alternatives along with
why your proposal is better, and any other known consequences of the
change.

Impact
------
Include corpus searches (http://korp.alexburka.com/) showing how much
previous usage your changes would validate, what they would invalidate,
and any other known impacts. Preferably list all effected words and
places.
